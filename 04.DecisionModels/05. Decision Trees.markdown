## Decision Trees

They're helpful when there are lots of contingencies or probabilistic events (uncertainty of the future). Decision tree is made of branches that represent the possible choices and the branch that has the highest payoff gets chosen. Choices are usually hard and there are probabilities or contingencies.

    1. Ticket for 3pm: $200
    2. 40% chance that I won't make it
    3. Ticket for 4pm: $400
    Which ticket do I buy?

Here's the decision tree for this problem:

             -----> $200
            /Make .6           
       --- *
      /     \Late .4
     /Buy    -----> $600
    *         
     \
      -----> $400
    
    Cost of buying the 3pm ticket:
    (0.6 * 200) + (0.4 * 600) = 120 + 240 = $360
    Cost of buying the 4pm ticket:
    $400
    
    The best choice is to buy the 3pm ticket ($360).

Another example:

    Scholarship: $5000
    200 applicants
      2 page essay
    10 finalists
      10 page essay
    What to do?
    
    Estimate the costs of writing the essays:
    2 page: $20
    4 page: $40

What to do?

* Step 1: Draw tree
* Step 2: Write down payoffs and probabilities
* Step 3: Solve Backwards

                  -----> $4940
                 /Win .1
              1 *
               / \Lose .9
              /   -----> -$60
          2 *
            / \Don't
           /   -----> -$20
          /Selected .05
      3 *
        / \Lose .95
       /   -----> -$20
    4 *
       \Don't
        -----> $0

To solve this problem, we have to work our way backwards and calculate the payoffs, from the ideal scenario to the starting point (1-2-3-4).

    1 => (0.1 * 4940) + (0.9 * -60) = 494 - 54 = 440
    2 => $440 vs -$20 ==> $440
    3 => (0.05 * 440) + (0.95 * -20) = 22 - 19 = 3
    4 => $3 vs $0 ==> $3
    So I should write the essay!

The interesting thing is that if there were 300 or 400 applicants, then writing the essay might not have been a good thing to do.

### Inferring Probabilities

Your friend tells you about a risky investment opportunity that will pay $50,000 on a $2,000 investment. She's in. Do you invest?

          -----> 50
         /Succeeds p
        *
       / \Fails (1-p)
      /   -----> -2
     *
      \Don't
       -----> 0
    
    50p - 2(1-p) > 0
    50p - 2 + 2p > 0
    52p > 2
    p > 2/52
    p ~= 4%

That means that she believes there's a chance higher than 4% that this investment will succeed, otherwise she wouldn't put her money in.

### Inferring Payoffs

You have a standby to go visit your parents. The airline says that there is a one third chance that you'll make the flight. You decide not to go to the airport and to stay on campus. How much did you want to see your parents?

          -----> V - c
         /Make flight 1/3
        *
       / \Don't make flight 2/3
      /   -----> -c
     *
      \Stay
       -----> 0
    
    [1/3 * (V-c)] + [2/3 * (-c)] < 0
    1/3 V - c < 0
    V < 3c

That means that the value _V_ of seeing your parents was less than three times the cost to go to the airport _c_. Maybe you didn't want to see your parents very much. If you did go to the airport, that means that `V > 3c`, so you did want to see them!
