* etc...

### Classes of Models

#### Multi-Criterion (lots of dimensions)

Choosing between two cars. Enumerate criteria and list pros and cons. Spatial comparison (e.g. speed x comfort). Choosing the car closer to the ideal point.

#### Probabilistic (balance risks because of uncertainty)

Choices with uncertainty (e.g. apply to a university). Make a decision tree and calculate the probability of each branch. Calculate the value of the information if the uncertainty went away.
