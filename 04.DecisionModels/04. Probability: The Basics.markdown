## Probability: The Basics

### Axioms

* Probability of an outcome [0, 1]
* Sum of all possible outcomes equals to 1
* _A_ subset of _B_, then `Prob(B) >= Prob(A)`

### Classical

You can write down what the probability is going to be. For example:

    # When rolling a die
    Prob(4)    = 1/6
    Prob(Even) = 1/2
    Prob(Odd)  = 1/2

### Frequency

You can count and estimate the probability. For example:

    # Do more words begin with _r_ or have _r_ as their third letter?
    - Count the words in a dictionary
    - Ramdomly browser the dictionary
    
    # Is it going to rain next June 7th?
    - Count the number of days it rained in the last 100 years
    - Assumption that nothing has changed over the last 100 yers (stationarity)

### Subjective

You have to guess what the probability is. A model might help doing so.

    # Shelly majored in political science and was very involved
    # in the college republicans. Write down probabilities for
    # the following events:
    - Event A: Flight attendant (5%)
    - Event B: Blogger (10%)
    - Event C: FLight attendant while finishing her MBA (10%)
    - Event D: Medical field (15%)

Something was wrong in the last example. `Event C` is contained in `Event A`, so its probability cannot be higher.

Whenever trying to do Subjective probability, we will try to use a model to better estimate our odds.
